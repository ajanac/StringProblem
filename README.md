# Pattern Searching Problem
This repository consist of two types of pattern search algorithm in Java and Junit. First one is the normal string searching which has runtime complecity O(mn).
Where m is the length of the pattern and n is the lenth of the string.
The second one is the KMP algorithm for pattern matching algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm), which has runtime O(m+n).
Here also m is the length of the pattern and n is the length of the string.
